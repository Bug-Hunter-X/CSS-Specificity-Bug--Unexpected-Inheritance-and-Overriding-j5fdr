The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpectedly overridden */
}

div span {
  color: purple; /* This rule works as expected */
}
```

The unexpected behavior lies in the `div p` selector.  While it should ideally override the `p` selector due to higher specificity, it's often unexpectedly overridden by the `div` selector in certain browsers or situations.  This is subtle, and may not manifest consistently across all browsers or CSS parsers.
