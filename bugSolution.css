The solution involves ensuring the specificity of the `div p` selector is high enough to override the `div` selector. Here are several approaches:

1. **Increase Specificity using IDs:** Assigning an ID to the parent `div` significantly increases specificity.

```css
#myDiv p {
  color: green;
}
```

2. **Using More Specific Child Selectors:** If IDs are not desired, you can increase specificity by specifying the parent-child relationship more explicitly.

```css
div > p {
  color: green; /* Direct child selector */
}
```

3. **Important Declaration (Use Sparingly):**  While generally discouraged due to potential maintenance issues, you can use `!important` in extreme cases (this is a last resort).

```css
div p {
  color: green !important;
}
```

Choosing the best solution depends on the overall CSS structure and context.  Prioritize using IDs or more specific child selectors to avoid unnecessary use of `!important`.
